# Coffin resources

The purpose of this repository is to preserve, translate, and digitise
the documents and references that pertain to the "Coffin problems".

It serves to aid in the work of cataloguing such mathematical problems,
which is carried out in the repository [`coffins`](https://github.com/coffinproblems/coffins).


## Status

Work is at a very early stage.

## Contributing

More details are provided in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

Here is a non-exhaustive list of ways to contribute:
- provide additional documents and sources to be digitised or translated
  (this also includes resources that are already available in multiple formats and/or multiple languages,
  since sometimes each version carries meaningful differences);
- help faithfully translating Russian documents to English
  (even those that have an English version available, since in some cases there are differences);
- submit scans of documents that are not otherwise available online,
  or better scans of documents than those that are currently available;
- help accurately digitising the documents listed [here](CONTRIBUTING.md#digitisation);
- help faithfully translating the documents listed [here](CONTRIBUTING.md#translation);
- report errors, inaccuracies, etc;
- suggest improvements to the transcriptions, translations, etc;
- suggest possible improvements to the LaTeX source code;
- sift through the cited [references](#references) to see if there are mentioned other resources.
- help to identify other sources, perhaps not available online but stored in University archives.
- get access to original physical documents.
- help contacting people that might be able to help further in any way.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details.


## Building

### Requirements
The documents are typeset in LaTeX,
and can be generated from the source code with any TeX distribution.


### Generate PDF

To generate the PDF file of a specific document,
navigate to its directory and run the following command from within that directory:
```shell
latexmk main.tex
```
The resulting file is placed in the `output` directory,
and the intermediate auxiliary files are placed in the `build` directory.

#### TeX engines
Compilation is possible with the pdfLaTeX and LuaLaTeX compilation engines;
the engine used by default is LuaLaTeX.

To compile with pdfLaTeX, set the `-pdflatex` option when running `latexmk`:
```shell
latexmk -pdflatex main.tex
```
or change `$pdf_mode = 4` to `$pdf_mode = 1` in the `latexmkrc` file.


### Generate ebook

> [!WARNING]
> Ebook generation is currently not reliable.

> [!NOTE]
> It is recommended to have [`tidy`](https://github.com/htacg/tidy-html5) installed.

For generating an ebook in `EPUB3` format, run this command from within the directory of the desired document:
```shell
tex4ebook -B ../build_epub3 -d ../output -f epub3 main.tex mathml
```
This generates the document in `EPUB` version 3, with mathematical notation encoded in the `MathML` format.
> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `MathML`-encoded results are currently broken:
> the generated documents have incomplete formulas, and messed up text and formatting.  
> Encoding Maths content as `svg` or `png` produces more usable results,
> though some issues persist.

For `SVG` Maths, use this command:
```shell
tex4ebook -B ../build_ebook_svg -d ../output -f epub main.tex svg
```

For `PNG` Maths, use this command:
```shell
tex4ebook -B ../build_ebook_png -d ../output -f epub main.tex png
```

> [!NOTE]
> The `epub` option in the above two commands can be replaced by any format among `epub`, `epub3`, `mobi`, `azw`, `azw3`;
> but in order to generate ebooks in `mobi`, `azw` and `azw3` formats,
> [calibre](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/calibre) needs to be installed,
> because `tex4ebook` uses the command `ebook-convert`, provided by calibre.

> [!NOTE]
> The commands described above use PDFTeX as engine.
> Compilation with LuaTeX is currently not working.  
> In any case, to use LuaTeX as engine anyway, use `tex4ebook -l` in place of `tex4ebook` in the commands.


### Reproducible builds

PDF builds are reproducible.  
In order to reproduce a PDF build,
use the same TeX distribution, version, and engine as the target file,
set the environment variable `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` to match that of the target build
(and consider setting `FORCE_SOURCE_DATE=1` too),
and use the same `-jobname` as the target:
```shell
SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH=0 FORCE_SOURCE_DATE=1 latexmk main.tex -jobname="jobname"
```
All the required parameters can be found [here](https://coffinproblems.github.io/resources/build_env.txt).


### PDF standards compliance

The PDF files are conformant with
the [PDF/A-4f](https://pdfa.org/resource/iso-19005-4-pdf-a-4/) standard,
and the accessibility standards
[PDF/UA-2](https://pdfa.org/iso-14289-2-pdfua-2/)
and [WTPDF-1.0 (Well-Tagged PDF)](https://pdfa.org/wtpdf);
their PDF version is [PDF 2.0](https://pdfa.org/resource/iso-32000-2/).

When building the project from source, by default the standard is set to
[PDF/A-2u](https://pdfa.org/resource/iso-19005-2-pdf-a-2/),
with PDF version [PDF 1.7](https://pdfa.org/resource/iso-32000-1/).

For building PDFs satisfying the other standards (`PDF/A-4f`, `PDF/UA-2`, `WTPDF-1.0`, `PDF 2.0`)
compile with this command:
```shell
latexmk -g -usepretex='\def\TAGPDF{}' main.tex
```
> [!NOTE]
> A TeX distribution version from 2025 or later is required for this.
> Additionally, compilation needs to be performed with LuaLaTeX (not with PDFLaTeX).

It is also possible to build PDF files satisfying
the [PDF/A-3a](https://pdfa.org/resource/iso-19005-3-pdf-a-3/) standard
and the accessibility standard [PDF/UA-1](https://pdfa.org/resource/iso-14289-pdfua/),
under PDF version [PDF 1.7](https://pdfa.org/resource/iso-32000-1/);
to do so, compile with this command:
```shell
latexmk -g -usepretex='\def\PDFAA{}' main.tex
```
> [!NOTE]
> A TeX distribution version from 2025 or later is required for this.
> Additionally, compilation needs to be performed with LuaLaTeX (not with PDFLaTeX).


#### Compliance validation
Verifying that a PDF file is conformant to certain PDF standards
can be done with [VeraPDF](https://verapdf.org/),
either online at [https://demo.verapdf.org/](https://demo.verapdf.org/),
or locally.
To test a PDF file locally, run the following command (note that it requires VeraPDF to be installed):
```shell
verapdf --flavour 0 --format text path/to/file.pdf
```
